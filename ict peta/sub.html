						Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that belong to the kingdom Animalia. They are characterized by their ability to move, consume organic matter as a source of energy, and undergo sexual reproduction. Animals come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and behaviors, and they play a crucial role in ecosystems and the balance of nature. They can be found in diverse habitats, from deep ocean trenches to high mountaintops. Examples of animals include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as well as invertebrates such as insects, spiders, and mollusks.

						Cells, the fundamental units of animal organisms, collaborate to form tissues, categorized into epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissues, each serving distinct functions. Organs, composed of multiple tissue types, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and brain, perform specific roles. These organs further integrate into organ systems like the digestive, respiratory, circulatory, nervous, and reproductive systems, each orchestrating coordinated functions. For instance, the digestive system, comprised of organs like the mouth, stomach, and intestines, along with associated tissues and cells, collaborates to break down food and absorb nutrients. In summary, the hierarchical organization of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems establishes the structural and functional foundation essential for animals to execute vital processes like nutrient processing, environmental response, and reproduction.

						Animals have several organ systems that work together to maintain the body's functions. While the number can vary depending on the classification of animals, These systems work together to perform vital functions such as obtaining and processing nutrients, exchanging gases, transporting nutrients and oxygen, responding to stimuli, providing structure and support, producing movement, eliminating waste, reproducing, regulating hormones, and defending against diseases and infections.

						The circulatory system in animals is responsible for the transport of nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. It plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and ensuring that all cells receive the necessary resources for functioning. The circulatory system can vary in complexity and structure across different animal species, but the main components and functions are generally similar.
