        <h2>Types of Muscle Systems</h2>
        <p>
        Skeletal muscles, also known as striated muscles, are attached to the bones and are responsible for voluntary movements such as walking, running, and jumping. They are under conscious control and are essential for locomotion and posture. Skeletal muscles are composed of long, multinucleated fibers that contract and relax in response to signals from the nervous system.<br><br>

        Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart and is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It has a unique structure that enables it to contract rhythmically without fatigue, ensuring that the heart can continue to pump blood without interruption.<br><br>

        Smooth muscles are found in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, blood vessels, and airways. They are responsible for involuntary movements such as peristalsis in the digestive system and controlling the diameter of blood vessels. Smooth muscles are not under conscious control and are regulated by the autonomic nervous system.

        In invertebrates, the muscular system can vary greatly in complexity. Insects, for example, have a highly developed muscular system that enables them to fly, crawl, and perform other precise movements.

        <h2>Importance of Muscular System</h2>
        <p>
        The study of the muscular system in animals is essential for understanding how they move and interact with their environment. It also has important implications for fields such as biomechanics, physical therapy, and veterinary medicine. Understanding the muscular system allows scientists and veterinarians to develop treatments and rehabilitation strategies for animals with muscle-related injuries or conditions.
