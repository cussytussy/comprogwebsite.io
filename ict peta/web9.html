        <h2>Vertebrate skeleton</h2>
        <p>
        In vertebrates, the skeletal system is divided into two main types: the axial skeleton, which includes the skull, vertebral column, and ribcage, and the appendicular skeleton, which includes the bones of the limbs and the girdles that attach the limbs to the axial skeleton.

        <h2>Invertebreate skeleton</h2>
        <p>
        In invertebrates, the skeletal system can take many forms, ranging from external exoskeletons made of chitin (found in arthropods like insects and crustaceans) to internal structures made of calcium carbonate (found in mollusks like snails and clams).

        <h2>Bones and Cartilage</h2>
        <p>
        -Bones are living tissues that are constantly being remodeled and repaired throughout an animal's life. They are made up of a dense outer layer called compact bone, which provides strength and support, and a spongy inner layer that contains bone marrow, where blood cells are produced.

        -Cartilage is a tough, flexible connective tissue that is found in the joints between bones and in other parts of the body such as the ears and nose. It provides cushioning and support for the bones and helps to reduce friction during movement.

        <h2>Importance of Skeletal System</h2>
        <p>
        The study of the skeletal system in animals is essential for understanding their anatomy, physiology, and evolution. It also has important implications for fields such as paleontology, veterinary medicine, and comparative anatomy. Understanding the skeletal system allows scientists and veterinarians to diagnose and treat bone-related injuries and diseases in animals and to reconstruct the evolutionary history of different animal groups based on their skeletal structures.
