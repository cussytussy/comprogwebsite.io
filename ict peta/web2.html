        <h2>Heart, BLood, and blood vessels</h2>
        <p>
        - Heart: The heart is the muscular organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It consists of chambers that collect and pump blood with the help of valves to ensure one-way flow.<br><br>

        - Blood vessels: Blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, form a complex network throughout the body for transporting blood to and from the heart and various tissues.<br><br>

        - Blood: Blood is the fluid that carries oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. It is composed of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma..</p>

        <h2>Open and CLosed Circulatory Systems</h2>
        <p>- Open circulatory system: Insects, mollusks, and some other invertebrates have an open circulatory system. In this system, the blood is not enclosed in vessels but flows freely in the body cavity, directly bathing the tissues in a fluid called hemolymph. The heart pumps hemolymph into open spaces called sinuses.<br><br>

        - Closed circulatory system: Vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and most fish, have a closed circulatory system. In this system, blood is enclosed in arteries and veins and does not come into direct contact with tissues. The heart pumps blood through a closed network of vessels, ensuring a more efficient and regulated transport of substances.</p>

        <h2>Function of the Circulatory System</h2>
        <p>
        1. The heart pumps oxygenated blood to the body's tissues through arteries.<br><br>

        2. In the tissues, oxygen and nutrients are exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products.<br><br>

        3. Deoxygenated blood returns to the heart through veins.<br><br>

        4. The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide.<br><br>

        5. Oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs and is then pumped back to the body, completing the circulation.

        <h2>Importanc of the Circulatory System</h2>
        <p>The circulatory system in animals is essential for distributing essential substances throughout the body, maintaining temperature, regulating pH and electrolyte balance, and transporting immune cells for defense against pathogens and foreign substances.

        Overall, the circulatory system plays a crucial role in sustaining life, allowing cells to receive nutrients, oxygen, and necessary substances while removing waste products, and maintaining the body's internal environment.</p>
