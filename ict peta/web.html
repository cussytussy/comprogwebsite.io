        <h2>Cells</h2>
        <p>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all animals. They are the building blocks of tissues and organs and are responsible for carrying out the various functions necessary for an animal's survival.</p>

        <h2>Tissues</h2>
        <p>Tissues are groups of similar cells that work together to perform a particular function. There are four main types of tissues in animals: epithelial tissue, which lines the surfaces of the body and organs; connective tissue, which provides support and structure; muscle tissue, which is responsible for movement; and nervous tissue, which transmits and processes information.</p>

        <h2>Organs and Organ systems</h2>
        <p>Organs are structures composed of two or more types of tissues that work together to perform specific functions within the body. Examples of organs in animals include the heart, lungs, liver, and brain.

        Organ systems are groups of organs that work together to perform coordinated functions. Animals have various organ systems, such as the digestive system, respiratory system, circulatory system, nervous system, and reproductive system, each responsible for specific physiological processes.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>For example, the digestive system is composed of organs such as the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines, as well as associated tissues and cells, all of which work together to break down food and absorb nutrients. The respiratory system includes organs like the lungs and trachea, and coordinating tissues and cells, which work together to exchange gases and facilitate breathing.</p>

        <p>Together, cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems form the structural and functional basis of animal bodies, allowing them to carry out essential processes such as obtaining and processing nutrients, responding to the environment, and reproducing.
