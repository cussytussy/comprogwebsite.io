        <h2>Digestive System</h2>
        <p>
        The main organs and structures of the digestive system in animals include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, and pancreas. Each of these organs has a specific role in the digestion and absorption of food.
        <br><br>

        The process of digestion begins in the mouth where food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin the breakdown of carbohydrates. The chewed food, now called bolus, is then swallowed and moves through the esophagus to the stomach.</p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p>In the stomach, the bolus is mixed with gastric juices, including hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes, to further break down the food into a semi-fluid mixture called chyme.<br><br>

        The chyme then passes into the small intestine, where the majority of digestion and nutrient absorption takes place. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine to further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The liver also plays a critical role in the digestion process by producing bile, which is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats.</p>

        <p>
        The small intestine is lined with millions of tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area available for the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.<br><br>

        The remaining undigested material then moves into the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed, and waste products are formed into feces for elimination.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall, the digestive system of animals is a complex and intricate system that allows for the breakdown of food and the absorption of essential nutrients, facilitating growth and the maintenance of the body's functions.</p>
