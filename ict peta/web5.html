        <h2>Key components of the immune system </h2>
        <p>
        1. White blood cells: White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are a crucial part of the immune system. They are produced in the bone marrow and are involved in various immune functions, such as phagocytosis (engulfing and destroying pathogens), producing antibodies, and coordinating immune responses.<br><br>

        2. Lymphatic system: The lymphatic system is a network of vessels, nodes, and organs, including the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, that helps carry lymph (a fluid containing white blood cells) and acts as a site for immune surveillance and response.<br><br>

        3. Antibodies: Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins produced by B cells in response to specific antigens (foreign substances). They recognize and bind to antigens, marking them for destruction by other immune cells.<br><br>

        4. Complement system: The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to help antibodies and phagocytic cells clear pathogens from the body. They also play a role in inflammation and immune regulation.

        <h2>Immune system functions</h2>
        <p>
        1. Recognition: The immune system recognizes and responds to foreign substances, such as pathogens or abnormal cells, through a complex interaction of different immune cells, receptors, and molecules.<br><br>

        2. Response: Upon recognition of a foreign invader, the immune system mounts a response that aims to neutralize or eliminate the threat. This response can involve various mechanisms, such as the production of antibodies, activation of phagocytic cells, and release of signaling molecules to recruit more immune cells to the site of infection.<br><br>

        3. Memory: Following an initial exposure to a specific pathogen, the immune system can develop a memory response. This memory allows the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively to the same pathogen if encountered again in the future.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Immune System</h2>
        <p>
        The immune system in animals plays a crucial role in maintaining health and protecting the body from infections and diseases. It is essential for overall well-being and survival. Different animal species have evolved unique immune system adaptations to protect themselves from specific pathogens and environmental challenges.
