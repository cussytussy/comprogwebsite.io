        <h2>The Nervous Systems</h2>
        <p>
        In vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS includes all the nerves outside of the CNS.

        <h2>Composition of Nervous System</h2>
        <p>
        The nervous system is composed of neurons, or nerve cells, which communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. These signals enable animals to sense their surroundings, make decisions, and carry out voluntary and involuntary actions. In addition to neurons, the nervous system also includes support cells called glial cells, which provide structural support and insulation for the neurons.

        <h2>Differences of Nervous Systems in animals</h2>
        <p>
        Animals can have varying levels of complexity in their nervous systems, depending on their evolutionary history and ecological niche. For example, invertebrates such as insects, mollusks, and annelids have simpler nervous systems compared to vertebrates, but they still exhibit complex behaviors and sensory capabilities.

        <h2>Importance of the Nervous System</h2>
        <p>
        The nervous system plays a critical role in animal behavior, allowing them to respond to stimuli such as touch, light, sound, temperature, and chemical cues. It also regulates involuntary actions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration.<br><br>

        The study of the nervous system in animals is essential for understanding how they perceive and interact with their environment, and how they adapt to different ecological challenges. It also has important implications for the fields of neuroscience, medicine, and animal behavior.
